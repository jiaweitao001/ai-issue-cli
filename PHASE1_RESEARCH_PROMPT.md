# Phase 1: Deep Research

## Core Task

Conduct **comprehensive technical research** on the Issue to provide a solid foundation for Phase 2.

⚠️ **No solutions should be proposed in this phase** - only information gathering and analysis.

## Available Skills (Use These First)

You have access to specialized tools to accelerate research:

### `get_issue_context` - Fetch Issue Details
```json
{
  "repo": "hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm",
  "number": 30340,
  "include": ["comments", "timeline", "linked_prs"]
}
```
Use this FIRST to get structured issue data including comments and linked PRs.

### `find_similar_implementations` - Find Similar Code
```json
{
  "file_path": "/path/to/target_resource.go",
  "scope": "service",
  "limit": 5
}
```
Use this to automatically find similar resource implementations instead of manual `ls` and `grep`.

## Key Principles

⚠️ **Stack trace ≠ Root cause** - Don't just look at the function pointed to by the error stack, must comprehensively check all related functions (CRUD) and call chains

⚠️ **Precise targeting** - Focus your research on the exact file/line number the Issue points to, don't diverge to "related" files

⚠️ **No assumptions** - Don't assume the issue has been fixed by another PR, don't infer root cause from error log surface symptoms

---

## Mandatory Research Checklist

### 1. Find Similar Implementations ⭐⭐⭐ (Most Critical)

**Preferred**: Use `find_similar_implementations` tool with scope "service" or "directory"

**Alternative** (if tool unavailable):
```bash
# Find similar resources in the same directory
ls -la path/to/resource/directory/

# Example: pim_eligible → find pim_active
# Compare differences between them, understand why other resources don't have this issue
```

**Must document**:
- Similar resource file paths
- Key implementation differences
- Why it doesn't have the problem
- **Exact field naming** (check SDK struct, note `_id`/`_name`/`_type` suffixes)

### 2. Search SDK Tools ⭐⭐

```bash
# Search for validation functions
grep -r "Validate.*ID\|Parse.*ID" vendor/

# Check already imported SDK packages
```

**Must document**:
- Found SDK function names and paths
- Whether applicable to current scenario

### 3. Check Code History ⭐

```bash
# Find recent changes
git log --oneline -20 -- path/to/file.go

# Search specific field changes
git log -p -S "field_name" -- path/to/file.go
```

**Must document**:
- Relevant commits from last 3 months
- When the issue was likely introduced

### 4. Identify Global Impact

```bash
# Search all usage locations of the field
grep -r "field_name" internal/services/
```

**Must document**:
- Create/Update/Read/Delete function locations
- Related resources (nested configurations, etc.)
- Locations that need synchronized modifications

### 5. Official Documentation

- Check Azure/AWS documentation for recommended practices
- Confirm expected API behavior

# Issue #[NUMBER] Research Report

## Problem Classification

**Type**: [🔧 CODE_CHANGE / 📖 GUIDANCE]

**Justification**: [One sentence explaining why this classification]

### Classification Criteria Reference
- 🔧 CODE_CHANGE: Bug fixes, missing features (already GA), validation issues, SDK not mapped, etc.
- 📖 GUIDANCE: User error, by design, needs upgrade, feature in preview, workaround sufficient, insufficient info

## Problem Overview

[2-3 sentences: what is the problem, affected resources, error messages]

## Initial Hypotheses

1. [Hypothesis A] - To be verified
2. [Hypothesis B] - To be verified

## Code Location

- Main file: `[path/to/file.go]`
- Key function: `[FunctionName]` (line [N])

## Similar Implementation Comparison

- Similar resource: `[path/to/similar_resource.go]`
- Key difference: [What it does differently]
- Why no problem: [Explanation]

## SDK Tools

- Function: `[package.FunctionName]`
- Path: `[vendor/path/to/package]`
- Applicability: [Yes/No] - [Reason]

## History Analysis

- Commit `[hash]`: [Description]
- Issue likely introduced: [Date or version estimate]

## Global Impact

- [ ] Create function: `[path:line]`
- [ ] Update function: `[path:line]`
- [ ] Read function: `[path:line]`
- [ ] Delete function: `[path:line]`
- [ ] Related resources: `[resource_name]`

## Key Findings

1. [Most important finding]
2. [Second most important finding]
3. [Third most important finding]

## Next Steps

- [ ] Verify hypothesis: [Which one]
- [ ] Reference implementation: `[file path]`
- [ ] Use SDK function: `[function name]`
- [ ] Modify locations: [List]
```

## Quality Check

Confirm before completion:
- [ ] Found at least 1 similar implementation
- [ ] Searched for SDK utility functions
- [ ] Reviewed git history
- [ ] Identified specific location (file/line number) pointed to by Issue
- [ ] Read official documentation
- [ ] **Did not assume the issue has been fixed by another PR**
- [ ] **Research scope is consistent with Issue description, no divergence**
- [ ] **Confirmed exact field naming** (SDK struct field name → Terraform field name)
- [ ] **Reviewed test patterns for similar fields**
