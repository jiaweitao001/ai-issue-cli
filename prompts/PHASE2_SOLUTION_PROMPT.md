# Phase 2: Solution Implementation

Based on Phase 1 research, design and implement a high-quality solution.

---

## ⚠️ Key Constraints (Most Important, Must Read)

### 1. Minimal Change Principle
- **Only fix the issue explicitly stated** - don't fix other issues "discovered along the way"
- If 1 line can fix it, don't change 3 lines; if existing patterns work, don't introduce new abstractions
- Additional improvements should be separate Issues/PRs, not mixed into current fix

### 2. Strictly Follow Issue Scope
- Fix **only where** the Issue points to (file/line number)
- Distinguish "what Issue requires" from "what I think should be improved" - only do the former
- Don't infer from error log symptoms, analyze root cause

### 3. Avoid Over-Engineering
- ❌ Don't add logs not requested by Issue
- ❌ Don't create new helper functions (unless existing code already has this pattern)
- ❌ Don't modify other files for "consistency"
- ❌ Don't assume all CRUD needs modification (unless Issue explicitly requires)
- ❌ Don't add tests the project doesn't need

### 4. Verify Assumptions
- Don't assume the issue "has been fixed by another PR"
- Reference historical PRs of similar Issues to understand project fix style
- If uncertain, adopt the **simplest** fix approach

> **Remember: Open source projects prefer minimal changes to reduce risk. "Doing more" ≠ "Doing better".**

### 5. High-Frequency Fatal Errors ⚠️

- **Field naming must be exact** - Check SDK struct to confirm, don't guess (e.g., `runtime_environment` vs `runtime_environment_name`)
- **New fields must have tests** - No matter how simple, acceptance tests cannot be omitted
- **Optional fields use `d.GetOk()`** - Don't use `d.Get()` directly, it will pass empty strings
- **Use `pointer.From()` in Read** - Safely handle nil values

---

## 📚 Reference Cases (Correct vs Wrong)

### Case 1: Issue #30849 (SKU Validation Missing)
- **Issue requires**: `HS_S_` SKU incorrectly rejected for setting `min_capacity`, CustomizeDiff only checked `GP_S_`
- **Standard fix**: Append `&& !strings.HasPrefix(..., "HS_S_")` after existing condition on line 120
- **Change amount**: 1 line
- **Common mistakes**: Creating `isServerlessSku()` helper function, modifying Create/Update functions (not requested by Issue)

### Case 2: Issue #31045 (Error After Resource Deletion)
- **Issue requires**: After manually deleting `storage_table_entity`, terraform plan errors, Read function lacks 404 handling
- **Standard fix**: Add `if response.WasNotFound(...) { d.SetId(""); return nil }` in Read function
- **Change amount**: 4 lines
- **Common mistakes**: Also handling 403, adding logs, modifying test files (not requested by Issue)

> **Learn from cases**: Standard fixes are **minimal changes**, only modify where Issue points to, don't expand scope.

## Core Principles

- 🎯 **Fix root cause, not symptoms** - Solve the root cause, don't work around the problem
- 🔍 **Reference first** - Use similar implementations and SDK functions found in research
- 📐 **Minimal modification** - Only fix issues explicitly stated (see constraints above)
- 🔐 **Dynamic validation** - CustomizeDiff uses API calls instead of hardcoding
- 📝 **Rigorous Schema** - Optional uses Default not Computed; add ValidateFunc for format requirements
- 🚫 **Don't invent solutions** - Before modifying framework/SDK code, must first search the codebase for existing implementations that solve **similar problems**, then follow that pattern

## 📚 Code Style Guidelines

Before writing code, must read and follow the azurerm project's code style guidelines:

- **Contributing Guide**: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/contributing
- Key documents:
  - `topics/guide-new-resource.md` - New resource development guide
  - `topics/guide-new-data-source.md` - New data source development guide
  - `topics/best-practices.md` - Best practices
  - `topics/schema-design.md` - Schema design guidelines

---

## 🛡️ Pre-commit Validation (terraform-provider only)

**If this changeset includes any `*_resource.go`, `*_resource_gen.go`, or `*_data_source.go` files** (i.e. terraform-provider Go code):

1. Before `git commit`, call the `validate_terraform_changes` MCP tool with:
   - `repoPath`: absolute path to the repo
   - `files`: the list of modified files (e.g. from `git diff --name-only`)
2. Any finding with `severity: "high"` (e.g. `field-naming-undeclared` —
   `d.Set/Get("key")` referring to a key not declared in any Schema) **must
   be fixed before committing**. These almost always indicate a typo or a
   forgotten Schema entry.
3. Findings with `severity: "medium"` (e.g. `field-naming-case` — snake↔camel
   drift) should be fixed unless there's a documented reason not to.

The validator self-skips on non-terraform-provider changesets, so calling it
is cheap. **Non-Terraform projects can ignore this section entirely.**

## Reference: Git Operations

> ⚠️ **Cross-platform**: Use double quotes `"` for commit message, single-line only, use `/` for paths

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b issue-[number]
# Modify code...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix #[number]: [short description]"
git log -1 --format="%H"  # Get commit hash
```

## Reference: Quality Standards

### ✅ Excellent Solutions
- Solve root cause, don't work around
- Reference similar implementations
- Use existing SDK functionality
- Simpler code
- **Modification scope matches Issue**

### ❌ Common Mistakes
- Only adding polling/delays (treating symptoms)
- Writing own regex/validation (reinventing the wheel)
- More complex code (adding branches, new functions)
- **Over-engineering**: Fixing issues not requested by Issue
- **Scope creep**: Issue points to file A, but modifying file B
- **Wrong assumptions**: Assuming issue has been fixed by another PR
- Using Computed instead of Default in Schema
- Not adding ValidateFunc when format requirements exist
- Using hardcoding instead of API calls in CustomizeDiff
- Changed Schema but didn't update documentation
